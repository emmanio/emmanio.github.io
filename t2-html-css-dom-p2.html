          <h3>What's all the hype about responsive webpages?</h3>
              <p>
                Responsive design is a solution that uses a flexible grid. Depending on the screen resolution, blocks of content are positioned differently on the page. Content remains the same and should therefore be written concisely. Some of the benefits of having a responsive web design are (flexibility of content moving from one screen to another seamlessly, improved user experience, easy to manage, cost effective, avoided duplicate content, faster page speeds) just to name a few.</p>

          <h3>What is semantic structure?</h3>
              <p>
                Semantic HTML refers to the idea that all your HTML markup should convey the underlying meaning of your content - not it’s appearance.</p>

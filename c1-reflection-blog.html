        <h3>What are your impressions?</h3>
            <p>
            There's a lot of support from the team to help you through the course and lots of opportunities to connect with other people.

            Like a sponge, absorb as much as I can and embrace it.

            <p>
              Not at this stage, I've spoken to a few people who have done the course before and it's what I expected (super supportive, sharing culture)

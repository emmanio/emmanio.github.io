    <h3>what's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h3>
    
    <p>
      Super immersive learning environment, equipping students with the in demand technical and soft skills to enter the tech industry.

    </p>
  
    <h3>what are your impressions?</h3>

    <p>
      There's a lot of support from the team to help you through the course and lots of opportunities to connect with other people.
    </p>

    <h3>how do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h3>

    <p>
      Like a sponge, absorb as much as I can and embrace it.
    </p>
    
    <h3>have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h3>

    <p>
      Not at this stage, I've spoken to a few people who have done the course before and it's what I expected (super supportive, sharing culture)
    </p>

    <h3>are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h3>

    <p>
      I'm really excited, and a wee bit nervous.</p>

          <b>HTML, CSS and the Dom</b>
          <br>
          The way I would describe HTML, CSS and the DOM would be using the analogy of a house. A website is like a house, HTML is
          the structure, and it also has sections within it just like a house has rooms. Each section contains different
          images and text. CSS is similar to how you would design the look of your house, in a website it defines how elements
          will look on your page, the size, position, shape and heaps more. I couldn’t think of an analogy to explain the
          DOM, essentially the DOM lets the browser know how to present your HTML document. It organises all your elements
          allowing the browser to represent them as we want it.
          <br><br> 
          <b>Boxifying design and the box model</b>
          <br>
          Boxifying design means taking all elements of a webpage and dividing them into boxes. It’s a really great and
          simple way to build the structure of your html. The box model is used when talking about design and layout. The
          CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of margins, borders, padding,
          and the actual content.
          <br><br>
          <b>Grid based design and responsive webpages</b>
          <br>
          Grid based design is a layout in web design, it’s essentially a system for creating order among elements in a website.
          Responsive design is a solution that uses a flexible grid. Depending on the screen resolution, blocks of content are 
          positioned differently on the page. Some of the benefits of having a responsive web design are (flexibility of content 
          moving from one screen to another seamlessly, improved user experience, easy to manage, cost effective, avoided duplicate 
          content, faster page speeds) just to name a few. Semantic HTML refers to the idea that all your HTML markup should convey 
          the underlying meaning of your content - not it’s appearance.

          <b>Chapter 1, Search Inside Yourself by Chade-Meng Tan</b>
          <br>
          Emotional intelligence has lots of benefits, one of which is the ability to create the conditions for happiness.
          The skills that can help us cultivate emotional intelligence can also help identify and develop the factors that
          contribute to our well-being. The foundation of emotional intelligence is having a strong, stable and perceptive
          attention. There is something called the ‘response flexibility’ which is the ability to pause before you react.
          When you experience a strong emotion, instead of reacting immediately you take a second, and make a conscious choice
          in how you want to react. This ‘response flexibility’ depends on having quality attention, which is trained through
          mindfulness meditation.
          <br><br>
          When we are having an emotional experience, it’s not just manifesting in our mind but also in our body. The body can tell us more vividly about what we are feeling than our mind can, and we should be looking to our body for signs about how we’re feeling.
          <br><br>
          At the end of the chapter you are asked to meditate for two minutes. I found that the time went really fast, and I had lots of thoughts coming in and out of my head. I tried the easy way (bringing attention to breathing) and the easier way (sit with no agenda). I found that focusing on my breath helped clear my mind.

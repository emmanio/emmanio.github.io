          <br>Scope determines the visibility of variables and other resources in areas of your code. In JavaScript there are
          two different types of scope,
          <b>global</b> and
          <b>local</b>. When you start writing JavaScript in a document, you are already in the global scope. There is only
          one global scope throughout a JavaScript document. A variable is in the global scope if it’s defined outside of
          a function. Variables that are defined inside a function are in the local scope. They have a different scope for
          every call of that function. This means that variables having the same name can be used in different functions.
          <br>
          <br>Scoping parts of your code helps improve efficiency, track bugs and reduce them. Scope also solves the naming problem
          when you have variables with the same name but in different scopes.

          <b>Empathy and the Monkey Business of Brain Tangos, Chapter 7</b>

          <br>This chapter was about developing empathy through understanding and connecting with others. Empathy increases with
          kindness and if you are strong in self-awareness you are also very likely to be strong in empathy. I tried the
          formal empathetic listening technique with my flatmate, the topic we chose was ‘a difficult work situation with
          a co-worker’. I could tell that he had a lot going on at work so this conversation was actually really beneficial
          for him. He was able to get all these emotions off his chest and I acknowledged that he felt patronised and annoyed,
          and he said that he felt reassured that I understood what he was feeling after his monologue. This chapter also
          introduced loving kindness meditation, where you create good wishes for others, and thereby creating the mental
          habit of kindness. I visualised my sister in this exercise. This was a really calming practice and I felt at peace
          and happy at the end.
          <br>
          <br> Practices for political awareness were also introduced, which is ‘the ability to read an organisations emotional
          currents and power relationships.’ The exercise asked the reader to write or talk about a difficult situation from
          your present or past and to describe the situation as though you were 100% correct and then do the same for the
          other person.
          <br>
          <br> A difficult situation from my past was when I wanted to interview a candidate for a role, someone who I would
          be managing. I knew this person and had managed them before and wanted to interview them because I believed that
          they would be a good addition to the team and already knew the role. I thought that I was reasonable because this
          person knew the role, and had already built rapport with the team and our clients. My manager did not see what
          I saw in this person and didn't want to interview them. It was perceived as a step back for the team and they
          wanted to have a fresh face in the organisation. My manager was being reasonable and so was I, we just had different
          opinions.

          My take on the EDA experience is that it is a super immersive learning environment, equipping students with the in demand
          technical and soft skills to enter the tech industry. My impressions so far - there is a lot of support from the
          team to help you through the course and lots of opportunities to connect with other people.
          <br>
          <br> I see myself engaging with this type of learning environment like a sponge, absorbing as much as I can and embracing
          it. I am only in my first week and so far my expectations haven’t changed, I spoke to a few people who have done
          the course before I started and it’s exactly the way that they described. I’m really excited to participate in
          this experience and I’m a wee bit nervous for the bootcamp in August.

          I tried the Pomodoro time box technique and I found it really effective, I felt like I was more productive doing
          smaller stints of focus and having regular breaks. One fact I found interesting after reading the content was that
          meditation can be linked to improving rapid memory recall. And that studies have shown that people who practiced
          meditation were able to adjust the brain wave that screens out distractions and increase their productivity more
          quickly than those that didn’t meditate. I’ve tried meditation in the past but never really got into it, I’d like
          to try to practice meditation more regularly and have downloaded the Headspace app.

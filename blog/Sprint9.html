          <br>This chapter (chapter 8) is about leading with compassion and influencing with goodness. The book explores three
          components of compassion, cognitive “I understand you,” affective “If feel for you” and motivational “I want to
          help you.” A training compassion practice called multiplying goodness was introduced which is an adaptation of the Tibetan tonglen
          practice where you breathe in suffering and breathe out relief to yourself and others. I found this method to be
          kinda scary and wasn’t really sure how to transform it within my heart to breathe out relief. I felt more comfortable
          with the multiplying goodness practice which helps you gain confidence in your own inner goodness and helps you
          see the goodness in others. I felt a surge of empathy and happiness after completing this practice where the tonglen
          practice left me confused.
          <br>
          <br> The SCARF model is about influencing with goodness. Our brains strive to increase positive experiences and avoid
          negative ones. The model describes the five domains of social experience that the brain treats as rewards or threats.
          I want to expand my influence using the SCARF model so that I can align my interests with the interests of others
          going into phase-0. I will do this through practicing loving kindness meditation regularly to expand my relatedness
          so that I can understand others and help them succeed. Throughout my journey so far I feel like I am more confident
          in my skills now than I was 6 weeks ago (status) and I feel like I have gained more resilience in controlling my
          environment and not letting stress get to me (autonomy).
          <br>
          <br> Another section of this chapter was communicating with insight and how to conduct difficult conversations. I had
          a difficult conversation with my flatmate. The situation was that they kept leaving dishes on the bench when the dishwasher was clean, and not pitching
          in to do our jobs around the house (like taking out the rubbish, vacuuming etc). My feelings were that they didn’t
          care about being part of the flat, or helping keep it tidy which meant that I had to do more work to make up for
          it. The conversation went well, and they said they had been really busy and stressed out at work so they were going
          to put together a roster that meant they could commit to those jobs on those days. I’m really happy with the outcome,
          I approached the situation from their perspective saying that I know they are really busy but that it would be a really
          great help if they could help out and I think it helped that I was trying to understand the situation from their point of view
          instead of just going into the conversation on the defensive.

          <br>This chapter explores the art of self motivation and introduces practices that help you find out how you want your
          life to unfold and how to navigate the path to get there.
          <br>
          <br> The first section was about the process of happiness in the context of work. There are three types: pleasure,
          passion and higher purpose. Pleasure is the the instant gratification kind of happiness and Hsieh describes it
          as the ‘rock star’ type of happiness. This is the most fleeting and short lasting and as soon as the source of
          the stimuli goes away, your happiness drops immediately. Passion, described in the book as ‘flow’ where peak performance
          meets peak engagement and time flies by. This type of happiness is significantly more sustainable than pleasure.
          Higher Purpose is serving a higher purpose and feeling connected to something larger and more powerful than yourself.
          This is the highest form of happiness and also the longest lasting. I’ve never thought about happiness in this
          context before, and realise that I am definitely living the majority of my life in the pleasure state of happiness.
          I want to focus more on passion, and I think this course so far has shown me that coding is a passion for me and
          I’m excited that I’ve finally found something that I’m passionate about in my work.

          <b>What are your core values and what do you stand for?</b>
          <br>
          <br>“I’ve learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget
          how you made them feel.” — Maya Angelou
          <br>
          <br> Kindness is a core value in my life, being kind to myself and to others. Everyone you meet in life is fighting
          a battle you know nothing about, take the time to not pass judgement and accept them for who they are.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</b>
          <br>
          <br>I found the exercise quite emotional, I felt really upset when I did the failure part and the four minutes seem
          to go on forever. I found it really difficult to seperate my emotions as just being physiological sensations and
          to let them come and go. They seemed to just stay and I felt really overwhelmed by them. This is a practice that
          was introduced briefly in the previous chapter where I also struggled with it.

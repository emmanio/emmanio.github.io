          <b>JavaScript use cases</b>
          <br><br><b>Parentheses</b>
          <br>Parentheses () are used to call a function, to surround conditional statements or for grouping to enforce order of operations.
          <br><br>
          <b>Braces</b>
          <br>Braces {} are used to declare object literals, or to enclose blocks of code (function definitions, conditional blocks, loops).
          <br><br>
          <b>Brackets</b>
          <br>Brackets [] are used for accessing the properties of an Object (or the elements of an Array), so mylist[3] fetches the fourth element in the Array.
          <br><br>
          <b>Single quotes or double quotes?</b>
          <br> Single quotes '' and double quotes "" can be used interchangeably and are pretty much the same thing. They both represent strings and you can use single quotes
          within a double quoted string (or vice versa).
          <br><br>
          <b>Chapter 5, riding your emotions like a horse</b> 
          <br>This chapter was about navigating through your emotions and triggers, usin a technique called the Siberian North RailRoad. I found this exercise to be really challenging, letting
          go of frustration and anger is not something that comes easily to me. I recognise that it is something I need to work on, and am determined to use this technique the next time I am 
          triggered and feeling negative emotions. When programming, my triggers are usually based around not being able to make something work which I think has to do with my fear of failure, my main 
          emotion is frustration and up until now I've dealt with this just by having a break and taking some time out.

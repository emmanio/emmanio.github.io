          <b>Some JavaScript use cases</b>
          <br><br>
          Parentheses
          <br>Parentheses () are used to call a function, to surround conditional statements or for grouping to enforce order of operations.
          <br><br>
          Braces
          <br>Braces {} are used to declare object literals, or to enclose blocks of code (function definitions, conditional blocks, loops).
          <br><br>
          Brackets
          <br>Brackets [] are used for accessing the properties of an Object (or the elements of an Array), so mylist[3] fetches the fourth element in the Array.
          <br><br>
          Single quotes or double quotes?
          <br> Single quotes '' and double quotes "" can be used interchangeably and are pretty much the same thing. They both represent strings and you can use single quotes
          within a double quoted string (or vice versa).
          <br><br>
          <b>Chapter 5, riding your emotions like a horse</b> 
          <br><br>This chapter was about navigating through your emotions and triggers, using a technique called the Siberian North RailRoad. I found this exercise to be really challenging, letting
          go of frustration and anger is not something that comes easily to me. When programming, my triggers are usually based around not being able to make something work, my main 
          emotion is frustration and up until now I've dealt with this just by having a break and taking some time out.

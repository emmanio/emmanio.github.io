          <b>Chapter 4, all natural, organic self-confidence</b>
          <br> Mindfullness and self awareness are essentially the same thing, minfullness is an 
          activity that results in awareness. Both can be trained in similar ways which is what was
          explored in this chapter. I tried the Body Scan practice, during the practice I felt very relaxed
          and by the end felt happy. I don't often just sit and check in with how I'm feeling and I think it's really important to take 
          the time to sit and check in with yourself. It makes a huge difference to your day. What I learnt from the 
          last section of the chapter is that emotions are physiologoical experiences that we can control. We can calm ourselves down, or ignore
          them but they don't define who we are.

          <b>Problem Solving Techniques</b>
          <br>
          I got blocked on one of the problems in the theory for sprint 5 - Fizz Buzz. I used pseudocode to write down what
          I wanted the programme to do then went back into my notes that I had written from the basic javascript course on
          freecodecamp to figure out what would work best. I knew that I needed a loop, and an if/else statement and from
          there I started to fill in the gaps. I felt good about the process because I had all the information I needed to
          solve the problem, it was just a matter of applying the right solution. It was really satisfying when it worked.
          I learnt that the remainder operator (%) is a way to test whether a number is divisible by another number. 
          <br> 
          <br>
          The problem solving techniques Iâ€™ve used so far are pseudocode, the rubber ducky method (I have a Tina Belcher pop
          vinyl), reading error messages and Googling. I only google as a last resort, and when I do I usually look for something
          on Youtube that explains more about the theory and how to do something as opposed to just finding a quick fix.
          I also look through the slack channel to see if someone else has encountered the same problem which I've found to be really helpful.

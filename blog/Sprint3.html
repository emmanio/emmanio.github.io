          <b>Responsive website</b>
          <br> A responsive website is a site that can adapt to the screen it’s being used on, regardless of what device it is.
          More people are using mobiles and tablets to view websites, so it’s important to make your website easy to read
          and navigate on a phone so you don’t loose those customers.
          <br><br>
          <b> Mobile first approach</b>
          <br> A mobile first approach is designing your site for the smallest screen and working your way up, it’s important
          to use this approach as a designer because it’s highly likely that your website will be viewed more on a phone
          than it will on a desktop.

          <br><br>
          <b> Chapter 2, breathing as if your life depends on it</b>
          <br> I always thought I wasn’t very good at meditation because I couldn’t keep my mind clear and my attention focused, 
          after reading chapter 2 I’ve learnt that meditation is like training a muscle and that the way I was feeling was
          completely normal. I learnt that a big part of mindfullness meditation is about setting an intention when you begin, 
          maybe it’s to reduce stress or to feel happier. Every time an intention is formed we are reinforcing a mental habit. 
          And if we create this same intention a lot it eventually becomes a habit that arises in our mind and we can use it to 
          guide our own behaviour. 
          <br><br>
          <b> Why we use frameworks</b>
          <br>
          A framework is a package made up of files and folders of standardised code which can be used as a basis to start
          building a website. The purpose of a framework is to provide a structure so that developers don’t have to redo
          their website from scratch and can copy and paste the code provided. A con of using a framework is that as a developer
          you should be learning the language, and copying and pasting a framework sort of stops you from doing that. There
          are lots of different frameworks to choose from, so it’s important to choose one that suits your needs so you aren’t
          limited when it comes to designing your site.
          <br>
          <br>
          The hardest part for me was the media queries and making my site compatible for mobile and other screen sizes. I've
          tried to reduce the clutter on the page when the screen gets smaller, but definitely not 100% happy with the outcome.
          Still have a lot to learn in this area.I think my issue was that I didn't start building my site for mobile first, and 
          went straight to building the website then realised after that I had to add media queries.

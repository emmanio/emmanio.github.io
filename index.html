        <br>
        <br>This chapter (chapter 8) is about leading with compassion and influencing with goodness. The book explores three
        components of compassion, cognitive “I understand you,” affective “If feel for you” and motivational “I want to help
        you.” A training compassion practice called multiplying goodness was introduced which is an adaptation of the Tibetan
        tonglen practice where you breathe in suffering and breathe out relief to yourself and others. I found this method
        to be kinda scary and wasn’t really sure how to transform it within my heart to breathe out relief. I felt more comfortable
        with the multiplying goodness practice which helps you gain confidence in your own inner goodness and helps you see
        the goodness in others. I felt a surge of empathy and happiness after completing this practice where the tonglen
        practice left me confused.
        <br>
        <br> The SCARF model is about influencing with goodness. Our brains strive to increase positive experiences and avoid
        negative ones. The model describes the five domains of social experience that the brain treats as rewards or threats.
        I want to expand my influence using the SCARF model so that I can align my interests with the interests of others
        going into phase-0. I will do this through practicing loving kindness meditation regularly to expand my relatedness
        so that I can understand others and help them succeed. Throughout my journey so far I feel like I am more confident
        in my skills now than I was 6 weeks ago (status) and I feel like I have gained more resilience in controlling my
        environment and not letting stress get to me (autonomy).
        <br>
        <br> Another section of this chapter was communicating with insight and how to conduct difficult conversations. I had
        a difficult conversation with my flatmate. The situation was that they kept leaving dishes on the bench when the
        dishwasher was clean, and not pitching in to do our jobs around the house (like taking out the rubbish, vacuuming
        etc). My feelings were that they didn’t care about being part of the flat, or helping keep it tidy which meant that
        I had to do more work to make up for it. The conversation went well, and they said they had been really busy and
        stressed out at work so they were going to put together a roster that meant they could commit to those jobs on those
        days. I’m really happy with the outcome, I approached the situation from their perspective saying that I know they
        are really busy but that it would be a really great help if they could help out and I think it helped that I was
        trying to understand the situation from their point of view instead of just going into the conversation on the defensive.

                Mindfullness and self awareness are essentially the same thing, minfullness is an 
                activity that results in awareness. Both can be trained in similar ways which is what was
                explored in this chapter. I tried the Body Scan practice, during the practice I felt very relaxed and by the end felt happy...

                Boxifying design means taking all elements of a webpage and dividing them into boxes. It’s a really great and
                simple way to build the structure of your html. The box model is used when talking about design and layout. The

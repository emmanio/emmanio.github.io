        <h3>What did you find interesting?</h3>

              One of the things meditation has been linked to is improving rapid memory recall. Catherine Kerr, a researcher at the Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging and the Osher Research Center found that people who practiced mindful meditation were able to adjust the brain wave that screens out distractions and increase their productivity more quickly that those that did not meditate. She said that this ability to ignore distractions could explain “their superior ability to rapidly remember and incorporate new facts.” This seems to be very similar to the power of being exposed to new situations that will also dramatically improve our memory of things.

        <h3>What worked for you?</h3>
            <p>
              The Pomodoro Technique was really great, I found that I was more productive having regular breaks and focusing for shorter periods of time.

          <h3>Which will you experiment further with?</h3>
            <p>
                I'd like to practice more mindful meditation.

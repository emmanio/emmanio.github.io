          <b>Chapter 4, Search Inside Yourself by Chade-Meng Tan</b>
          <br> Mindfullness and self awareness are essentially the same thing, minfullness is an 
          activity that results in awareness. Both can be trained in similar ways which is what was
          explored in this chapter. I tried the Body Scan practice, during the practice I felt very relaxed
          and by the end felt happy. I don't often just sit and check in with how I'm feeling and I think it's really important to take 
          the time to sit and check in with yourself. It makes a huge difference to your day. What I learnt from the 
          last section of the chapter is that emotions are physiologoical experiences that we can control. We can calm ourselves down, or ignore
          them but they don't define who we are. 
          <br><br>
          
        <!--<b> Control flow and loops </b>
          <br> Control flow relates to the order in which tasks or code is run. For example:
          <br>
          <br> Wake up
          <br> Tired => Press snooze
          <br> Not tired => Get out of bed
          <br> Loops iterate over the same piece of code until the condition turns false. For example:
          <br> Go to bathroom and brush teeth
          <br> Are teeth clean?
          <br> No => Action: Up then down
          <br> Yes => Stop Brushing
          <br><br>
          <b> Difference between accessing data from arrays and object literals</b>
          <br>
          Arrays and object literals can contain items. The difference between them is how those items are stored. With
          arrays they will just be a list of items: 27, Pakenham St, Cat, however, with object literals we can go a step
          further to give ID's to each of the object items: Age: 27, Area of Work: Elgin St, Cat or Dog: Cat. They also differ
          in how we access those values. With Object literals, you access their values using dot notation (console.log(person.location);),
          with arrays, you access the values using numerical index (console.log(array[2]);)
          <br><br>
          <b>What are functions and why are they useful</b>
          <br>Functions are a block of code that can be called upon to perform a task or calculate a value. It can take arguments,
          manipulate arguments/set variables and/or return a variable. It helps make code easier to read and saves you from
          repeating yourself.

          <br>
            I had a mindfullness conversation with my flatmate, I really enjoyed this exercise and found that we were closer
            friends after our conversation. We followed the structure as suggested in the book and we both took turns talking
            and listening. I found not speaking while he was speaking to be really challenging! He said that he found it
            an interesting exercise and and found the dipping and listening part to be the most challenging, because he was
            checking in with how he was feeling but also trying to listen and not forget anything. I'm definitely going to
            try walking meditation, and focused & open attention next time I meditate.

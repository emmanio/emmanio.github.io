# The Beginning of the End

This is a website I created during phase 0 of my bootcamp with Enspiral Dev Academy. Phase 0 is approximately 200 hours and is split into 9 sprints. You must complete these 9 sprints before you can attend the nine week bootcamp. Developed using HTML & CSS.


Each sprint has different questions and topics to cover. We were also encouraged to read a book called Search Inside Yourself by Chade-Meng Tan and reflect on the chapters we read.


Here's a link to the [blog](https://emmanio.github.io), enjoy!

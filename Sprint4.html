          JavaScript vs HTML and CSS
          <br>
          <br> HTML is a structural language used to build websites. CSS is a styling language that designs what a website will
          look like. JavaScript is a more advanced language to make web pages dynamic. These three languages have differences,
          but they are used in unison to present websites.
          <br>
          <br> Control flow and loops
          <br>
          <br> Control flow relates to the order in which tasks or code is run. For example:
          <br>
          <br> Wake up
          <br> Tired => Press snooze
          <br> Not tired => Get out of bed
          <br> Loops iterate over the same piece of code until the condition turns false. For example:
          <br> Go to bathroom and brush teeth
          <br> Are teeth clean?
          <br> No => Action: Up then down
          <br> Yes => Stop Brushing
          <br>
          <br> Difference between accessing data from arrays and object literals
          <br>
          <br> Arrays and object literals can contain items. The difference between them is how those items are stored. With
          arrays they will just be a list of items: 27, Pakenham St, Cat, however, with object literals we can go a step
          further to give ID's to each of the object items: Age: 27, Area of Work: Elgin St, Cat or Dog: Cat. They also differ
          in how we access those values. With Object literals, you access their values using dot notation (console.log(person.location);),
          with arrays, you access the values using numerical index (console.log(array[2]);)
          <br>
          <br>What are functions and why are they useful
          <br>
          <br> Functions are a block of code that can be called upon to perform a task or calculate a value. It can take arguments,
          manipulate arguments/set variables and/or return a variable. It helps make code easier to read and saves you from
          repeating yourself.

          <br> Chapter 3, Search Inside Yourself by Chade-Meng Tan
          <br>
            I had a mindfullness conversation with my flatmate, I really enjoyed this exercise and found that we were closer
            friends after our conversation. We followed the structure as suggested in the book and we both took turns talking
            and listening. I found not speaking while he was speaking to be really challenging! He said that he found it
            an interesting exercise and and found the dipping and listening part to be the most challenging, because he was
            checking in with how he was feeling but also trying to listen and not forget anything. I'm definitely going to
            try walking meditation, and focused & open attention next time I meditate.

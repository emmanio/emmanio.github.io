            <h3>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM?</h3>
              <p>
                A website is like a houseâ€¦ 
                </p>
              <p>
                HTML is like the frame of the house - it is the structure of your web page, it has sections (just like a house has rooms) and each section contains different images and text. 
                </p>
              <p>
                CSS is similar to how you'd design the look of your house - it defines how elements will look on your web page describing the size, position, shape, colour and heaps more.          
                </p>
              <p>
                The DOM lets the browser know how to present the HTML document. It organises all the HTML elements in the tree structure allowing the browser to represent them as we want it.

          <h3>What is meant by boxifying design?</h3>
              <p>
                Boxifying design means taking all elements of a webpage and dividing it into boxes. For example, this page is one big box, but also has a box for the header and a box for text.</p>

          <h3>What is the box model?</h3>
              <p>
                The box model is essentially a box that wraps around your html elements. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and your actual content.      </p>

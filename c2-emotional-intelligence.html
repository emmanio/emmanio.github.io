        <h3>Learnings - Chapter 1
        </h3>
        <p class="chapter-heading">
          What lies behind us and what lies ahead of us are tiny matters to what lies within us - Ralph Waldo Emerson
        </p>

          <p>
              Emotional intelligence has lots of benefits, one of which is the ability to create the conditions for happiness. The skills that can help us cultivate emotional intelligence can also help identify and develop the factors that contribute to our well-being.

              Training Attention
          </p>
          <p>
              The foundation of emotional intelligence is having a strong, stable and perceptive attention. There is something called the ‘response flexibility’ which is the ability to pause before you react. When you experience a strong emotion, instead of reacting immediately you take a second, and make a conscious choice in how you want to react. This ‘response flexibility’ depends on having quality attention, which is trained through mindfulness meditation.

              Listening to your body
          </p>
          <p>
              When we are having an emotional experience, it’s not just manifesting in our mind but also in our body. The body can tell us more vividly about what we are feeling than our mind can, and we should be looking to our body for signs about how we’re feeling.

              Meditation
          </p>
          <p>
              At the end of the chapter you are asked to meditate for two minutes. I found that the time went really fast, and I had lots of thoughts coming in and out of my head. I tried the easy way (bringing attention to breathing) and the easier way (sit with no agenda).  I found that focusing on my breath helped clear my mind.
